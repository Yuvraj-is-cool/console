<h1>Project On Console</h1>
<p>So first to get to Visual Studio Code You want to first download from a link or the appstore. Then you open it up and open a folder.
    After opening that folder go to the left and click the new  file button and type: index.html. Now go  in that andd type: <html></html> 
    then inside that make a a head tag and add a title in that. Then make the boddy tag and inside that is where most of your coding will be.

<p>Ok now you want to type in the console screen? That is mainly used to put notes or messages for coding and other stuff. And  if you want to check it go to the website 
    and click inspect and click the console button. So you want to type in it? Ok now go back to your code and go to the body. Now type <script></script> and inside that type console.log ("").
